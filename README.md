# Pooled Testing for COVID-19
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook containing some Python code to validate a pooled testing algorithm that could save millions on the code of large-scale antigen testing for COVID-19.
I have described this in my blog www.science4performance.com
The paper describing the algorithm can be found here https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14934.pdf
