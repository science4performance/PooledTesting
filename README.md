# Pooled Testing for COVID-19
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook containing some Python code to validate a pooled testing algorithm that could save millions on the cost of large-scale antigen testing for COVID-19.
I have described this in my blog https://science4performance.com/2020/07/15/efficient-covid-testing-on-a-hypercube/
The paper describing the algorithm can be found here https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14934.pdf
